# Glories of Featured Games

Ever wondered what it takes to be featured by Riot Games? Ever wondered how featured games differ from non-featured games? This is an entry for Riot's League of Legends API challenge that generates a visualisation of statistics of champions banned and selected, spells selected, and summoner names in featured games

## Workings

API_KEY.py contained the api key as:
key = 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx'


retrieve.py was executed every minute, with imported time methods. This populated the directory with the matches from the bucket list.

parse_matches.py was then executed to produce a winmap file.

The winmap file could be hosted separately, or copied into supermegacountertable.html to render the visualisation.

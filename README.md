# Glories of Featured Games

Ever wondered what it takes to be featured by Riot Games? Ever wondered how featured games differ from non-featured games? This is an entry for Riot's League of Legends API challenge that generates a visualisation of statistics of champions banned and selected, spells selected, and summoner names in featured games

## Workings

API_KEY.py contained the api key as:
key = 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx'

imported.py was executed to import already created data in the directory

retrieve.py was executed every x-specified minute for y-specified time, done with imported time methods. This populated the directory with the matches from the bucket list.
